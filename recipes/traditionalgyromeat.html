    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop an onion.</li>
        <li>Combine onions, lamb, beef, garlic, oregaon, cumin, marjoram, rosemary,
            thyme, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined.
            Cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours. 
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the over to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place the meat mixture into a food processor and pulse until Finely
            chopped and the texture feels tackey. Transfer for a loaf pan and 
            pack down so there are no air pockets.
        </li>
        <li>Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place the loaf pan in the 
            center of the roasting pan and transfer to the oven. Carefully pour boiling 
            water into the roasting pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until gyro meat is no longer pink in the center
            and the internal temperature registers 165 degrees. 
        </li>
        <li>Pour off any accumulated fat, and allow to cool slightly before 
            slicing.
        </li>
